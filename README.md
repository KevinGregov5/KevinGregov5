## Logit Regression

## DataSet

The data set I will use to perform a logit regression is the Rossi
dataset from the AER package. The data set contains information on 432
individuals released from prison and tracks whether they were
re-arrested within a specific period.

## Key Variables I will analyze

- Binary Dependent Variable: Rearrested(1 = Yes, 0 =
No)

- Independent Variable: race(black,other)

- Independent Variable: Marriage(not married,
married)

- Independent Variable: Work Experience(yes,
no)

- Independent Variable: Financial Assistance(yes,
no)
