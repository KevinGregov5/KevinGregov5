## Logit Regression

## DataSet

The data set I will use to perform a logit regression is the Rossi
dataset from the AER package. The data set contains information on 432
individuals released from prison and tracks whether they were
re-arrested within a specific period.

## Key Variables I will analyze

- Binary Dependent Variable: Rearrested(1 = Yes, 0 =
No)

- Independent Variable: race(black,other)

- Independent Variable: Marriage(not married,
married)

- Independent Variable: Work Experience(yes,
no)

- Independent Variable: Financial Assistance(yes,
no)

## Research Questions

- Does race influence the likelihood of being
re-arrested?

- Does marriage status impact the likelihood of being
re-arrested?

- Does having work experience reduce the likelihood of
re-arrest?

- Does financial assistance reduce the likelihood of
re-arrest?

## Statistical Tests

- Logit Regression
- Likeihood Ratio Test
- AIC and BIC Values
- Obtaining Probabilities 

## Results

- Adding more predictors to my model improves the model's fit because the AIC values and BIC values decrease as the numbers of predictors increase. So model 4 is the best fit model because it has the lowest AIC and BIC values compared to the other models.
  
- For the Likelihood Ratio Test all the p-values are < 0.05, so adding Marriage, Work Experience, and Financial Assistance significantly improves the model's fit. So Model 4 would be the best fit model.
